    <h2>What is This?</h2>
      <p>This is an original game made in a team of 4 in roughly 1 month. The objective was to build and release a complete, novel, interesting game, including
        <a href="https://unproductiveproductions.itch.io/antivirus">marketing materials</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>How Was it Made?</h2>
      <p>This game is built on Unity and C#. I especially worked on level design, enemy design, UI, some game design concepts, and miscellaneous other subsystems, such as player
        health. Additionally, I made art for the level tileset and all of the enemies. I also wrote the Pulitzer-prize worthy dialogue, and edited the Oscar-worthy game trailer, 
        found on the <a href="https://unproductiveproductions.itch.io/antivirus">itch.io page</a>.
        Aside from that, I also used Jira for project management, git for version control, and Aseprite for sprite creation/modification.
